# noeriats
Custom keyboard layout for programming. Dvorak/Colemak/Workman alternative

## Summary

![noeriats.png](https://github.com/AttackOnTyler/noeriats/blob/main/Noeriats/noeriats.png)

Using a text corpus as well as some open source projects in various languages, this keyboard layout is algorithmically generated to have a lower travel distance off the homerow, while being cognizant of the most common bigrams and trigrams to maximize out to in rolling.

Number keys are split odd and even and common symbol keys take precedence over less commonly used keys such as J and Q.

## Installing

There are two installation procedures, one being portable and the other modifying the language pack in Windows to have an alternate English Keyboard layout.

### Portable install

Most companies don't like you making changes to the OS, as such I've made the noeriats.ahk in conjuction with [AutoHokKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/) to get a locally installable layout on restricted work PCs.

Has the added advantage of keeping keyboard shortcuts in tact, only modifying the layout of the keys with no special key held and the shift keys.

### Language Pack install

Use either the setup.exe or just run the noeriats.msi to install the English Noeriats keyboard layout on your machine. This applies the change for all accounts on that machine and has a keyboard shortcut to switch between QWERTY and Noeriats on the fly.
